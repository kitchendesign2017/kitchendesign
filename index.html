  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>This is a proposed initial kitchen layout. Details are still
    subject to change, but this is an attempt to verify that appliances
    will fit. Also, I didn't spend a lot of effort picking perfectly
    designed 3D models of all cabinets. Don't pay attention to
    finishes at this point.</p>

  <p>The kitchen is intended to be fully functional for everyday use,
    but it does rely on storage outside of the kitchen for rarely used
    items (e.g. special purpose small counter-top appliances, fresh
    towels, bulky pantry items, ...).</p>

  <p>In order to maximize fridge/freezer space, we are going to use a
    <a href="http://www.subzero-wolf.com/sub-zero/full-size-refrigeration/builtin-refrigerators/36-inch-built-in-refrigerator"
       >Sub-Zero 36" all-fridge</a>, and two
    <a href="http://www.subzero-wolf.com/sub-zero/counter-refrigerator/30-inch-freezer-drawers-panel-ready"
       >30" under-counter freezer drawers</a>. This nominally provides 23.3
    cu.&thinsp;ft. of refrigerator space, and 9.8 cu.&thinsp;ft. of
    freezer space.</p>

  <p>We had considered using two
    <a href="https://www.perlick.com/residential/products/freezers/view/24-signature-series-indoor-freezer-drawers"
       >Perlick 24" under-counter freezer drawers</a> for nominally 10.4
    cu.&thinsp;ft. of freezer space, instead. That would be a more
    efficient use of the available space, and we overall think the
    Perlick units are a nicer design. Unfortunately, we cannot figure
    out how to solve our need for an ice maker -- and we don't really
    need a dedicated 50lbs ice makers. But this question might need
    some review.</p>

  <p>The freezer drawers are directly next to the
    range. I <em>think</em> that is permissible, but we might want to
    double-check with local code restrictions. We also might want to
    install an insulated filler-strip just to be conservative.</p>

  <p>We will continue using the existing
    <a href="http://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/30-rnb-series-range/"
       >30" BlueStar RNB range</a>. We had hoped to upgrade to a
    Platinum series range that was a little wider. But upon further
    review, it turns out the main motivation would be getting an
    additional small (i.e. fast pre-warm) oven. Achieving that goal requires at
    least a 48" range, which seems impractical in the available
    space. So, instead, we'll install a dedicated steam wall oven.</p>

  <p>We want a plumbed steam oven, which (in the US market) pretty much narrows
    it down to a Miele. There is talk about a larger version being
    released in fall, but we are probably fine with the existing
    <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/steam-oven-1466.htm?mat=10256790&name=DGC_6800-1"
       >24"Ã—18" combi steam oven.</a>.<p>

  <p>We also need a solution for a micro-wave, even if we expect that
    it will be used much more rarely. For now, we picked the most
    <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/speed-ovens-1457.htm?mat=09862960&name=H_6200_BM"
       >basic Miele model</a> available, in order to easily match with the steam
    oven. The speed oven feature is a nice bonus, but is not entirely
    critical for our needs. So, we could revisit this decision. An
    alternative product would for instance be the <a
    href="http://www.smegusa.com/product/su45mcx1/">SmegUSA Speedoven.</a></p>

  <p>We will continue using the existing
    <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/range-of-dishwashers-2498.htm"
       >24" Miele dishwasher</a>.</p>

  <p>We have gotten very used to our trash compactor and will buy the
    <a href="http://www.kitchenaid.com/shop/major-appliances-1/disposers-and-compactors-2/disposers-and-compactors-3/-[KTTS505ESS]-408529/KTTS505ESS/"
       >current KitchenAid model</a>, as that's apparently the only
    option on the market, anyway.</p>

  <p>No decision on garbage disposal, as of yet. But that should be
    pretty easy to nail down.</p>

  <p>Similarly, no decision on the vent hood yet. We need to narrow down
    the cabinet design a little more before we can decide on whether we
    want a liner or a full hood. We probably want a remote blower and an
    in-line muffler to minimize noise, though. We most likely will need a
    <a href="http://www.fantech.net/solutions/residential-kitchens/true-makeup-air-system/"
       >make-up-air system</a>, too.</p>

  <p>We looked at a couple of water-filter options, but haven't
    reached a conclusion at this point. And regretfully, we might not
    be able to get the water carbonation solution that I had originally been
    hoping for. It sounds as if the product has possibly been taken
    off the US market.</p>

  <p>An alternative option would be the
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LNJYZYO/ref=psdc_6810579011_t2_B00CKYO58M"
       >Grohe water carbonation</a> system. I am still figuring out
    whether the reviews are mostly positive or mostly negative. It
    sounds as if a lot of the negative reviews are a result of poor
    installation, which could skew results.</p>

  <p>The layout currently shows 3+ feet of pantry space. That's a nice
    upgrade over what we have right now. But in practice, we'll
    probably have to shave some space off of the pantry. Most notably,
    there currently are very few places for drawers -- next to the
    refrigerator and possibly under the microwave. And these places
    compete with storage space for pots. So, consider the big pantry a
    place-holder and we'll finalize the exact layout later.</p>
