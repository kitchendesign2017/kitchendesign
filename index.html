  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>This is a proposed initial kitchen layout. Details are still
    subject to change, but this is an attempt to verify that appliances
    will fit. Also, I didn't spend a lot of effort picking perfectly
    designed 3D models of all cabinets. Don't pay attention to
    finishes at this point.</p>

  <p>All countertops are going to be a little higher than standard, in
    order to make it easier for us to work on them without bending
    down. For now, I am going with 38", but we can finalize details
    later.</p>

  <p>Instead of 24", countertops are going to be 30" deep. We'll have
    to either build a custom shelve behind the range, or we'll have to
    modify it with a Bluestar island-trim vent. This probably also
    means that the upper cabinets will gain an extra 6" in depth.</p>

  <p>For the time being, I have drawn the top of the upper cabinets at
    8 feet from the floor. That is definitely something we need to
    still finalize.</p>

  <p>The kitchen is intended to be fully functional for everyday use,
    but it does rely on storage outside of the kitchen for rarely used
    items (e.g. special purpose small counter-top appliances, fresh
    towels, bulky pantry items, ...).</p>

  <p>While we have gotten initial rough pricing information, we'll
    have to go back and get exact pricing, when we have a better idea of
    the final appliance choices. At that point, we might have to make
    additional revisions based on pricing or availability.</p>

  <p>In order to maximize fridge/freezer space, we are going to use a
    <a href="http://www.subzero-wolf.com/sub-zero/full-size-refrigeration/builtin-refrigerators/36-inch-built-in-refrigerator"
       >Sub-Zero 36" all-fridge</a>, and two
    <a href="https://www.perlick.com/residential/products/freezers/view/24-signature-series-indoor-freezer-drawers"
       >Perlick 24" under-counter freezer drawers</a>. This nominally
    provides 23.3 cu.&thinsp;ft. of refrigerator space, and
    10.4 cu.&thinsp;ft. of freezer space. The freezer drawers will
    be installed in a kitchen island just outside of the actual
    kitchen. This island extends into the dining table.</p>

  <p>We will continue using the existing
    <a href="http://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/30-rnb-series-range/"
       >30" BlueStar RNB range</a>. We had hoped to upgrade to a
    Platinum series range that was a little wider. But upon further
    review, it turns out the primary motivation would be getting an
    additional small (i.e. fast pre-warm) oven. Achieving that goal requires at
    least a 48" range, which seems impractical in the available
    space. The secondary motivation would have been a <em>slightly</em>
    bigger cook surface with maybe two more burners. But that's not
    as important. So, instead, we'll stay with what we have and
    install a dedicated steam wall oven.</p>

  <p>We want a plumbed steam oven, which (in the US market) pretty much narrows
    it down to a
    <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/steam-oven-1466.htm?mat=10256790&name=DGC_6800-1"
       >Miele 24"×18" combi steam oven</a>.<p>

  <p>We also need a solution for a micro-wave, even if we expect that
    it will be used much more rarely. We picked the most
    <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/speed-ovens-1457.htm?mat=09862960&name=H_6200_BM"
       >basic Miele model</a> available, in order to easily match with the steam
    oven. The speed oven feature is a nice bonus, but is not entirely
    critical for our needs.</p>

  <p>No decision has been made on the vent hood yet. We need to narrow down
    the cabinet design a little more before we can decide on whether we
    want a liner or a full hood. We probably want a remote blower and an
    in-line muffler to minimize noise, though. We most likely will need a
    <a href="http://www.fantech.net/solutions/residential-kitchens/true-makeup-air-system/"
       >make-up-air system</a>, too.</p>

  <p>We will continue using the existing
    <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/range-of-dishwashers-2498.htm"
       >24" Miele dishwasher</a>.</p>

  <p>We have gotten very used to our trash compactor and will buy the
    <a href="http://www.kitchenaid.com/shop/major-appliances-1/disposers-and-compactors-2/disposers-and-compactors-3/-[KTTS505ESS]-408529/KTTS505ESS/"
       >current KitchenAid model</a>, as that's apparently the only
    option on the market, anyway.</p>

  <p>The sink has not been specified in detail, yet. For now, our
    thinking is that we'll have an asymmetrically divided custom-built
    farmhouse sink. The divider should be low enough that I can hopefully wash
    a cookie sheet in the sink without too much trouble. We'll need to
    research what type of sink grids are available for the larger
    partition, or if we can forgo that.</p>

  <p>The sink will have a soap dispenser that directly plugs into a
    large supply bottle (i.e. Costco sized).</p>

  <p>We should try to find a way to store a pull-out trashcan for
    recycling underneath the sink.</p>

  <p>We'll have a garbage disposal in the smaller partition of the
    sink. No decision on exact specifications for the garbage
    disposal, as of yet. But that should be pretty easy to nail
    down.</p>

  <p>There should be a pot filler at the back of the stove.</p>

  <p>We looked at a couple of water-filter options, but haven't
    reached a conclusion at this point. And regretfully, we might not
    be able to get the water carbonation solution that I had originally been
    hoping for. It sounds as if Everpure has taken their product
    off the US market.</p>

  <p>An alternative option would be the
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LNJYZYO/ref=psdc_6810579011_t2_B00CKYO58M"
       >Grohe water carbonation</a> system. I am still figuring out
    whether the reviews are mostly positive or mostly negative. It
    sounds as if a lot of the negative reviews are a result of poor
    installation, which could skew results.</p>

  <p>The layout currently shows about 3 feet of pantry space. That's a nice
    upgrade over what we have right now. But in practice, we'll
    probably have to shave some space off of the pantry as we finalize
    cabinet space. So, consider the big pantry a place-holder and we'll
    figure out the exact layout later.</p>

  <p>Also, there is currently no obviously good location to place
    towels or pot holders. The wall next to the window is probably the
    best place to consider for this purpose.</p>

  <p>The remaining counter-top appliances at this point are the water
    kettle and the toaster. While not a high priority, we should
    brain-storm if these two appliances can be eliminated.</p>
